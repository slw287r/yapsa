  CHANGES IN VERSION 1.13.3

This is a stable version after several important changes.

* 95% Confidence intervals for exposures to mutational signatures can be 
    computed
* Analysis of the PCAWG mutational signatures is supported, both for PCAWG 
    SNV and PCAWG Indel signatures

The vignettes have been substantially changed:

* new vignettes have been written for the new features confidence intervals 
    and Indel signatures
* new vignettes were added for features already present in the package before,
    especially the optimal signature-specific cutoffs
* the topic of stratifiec analyses of mutational signatures was taken out of 
    the main vignette and now is described in a vignette on its own.
